# Telegram-Crawler
The plan so far:
1. Explore if it is possible to obtain output from Telegram-cli to csv/txt
2. Thats all for now.

## Further objectives
To be able to parse the data into something useful we can run analytics on.
Specifically community analytics based on metrics that are backed by research.
